Hi! Welcome to my story page! 

You will see the following three sections: World Population, Populations vs. Regions and Populations vs. Income Groups. 

In the World Population tab, you can explore the overall situation with me. Then, the population density trends of different regions and different income groups from 1960 to 2020 are in the other two sections. 

Feel free to enjoy your time here!
