      <description>Welcome to the first part of my blog!
The following World Population Trend 1960-2020 will give you an overview of population density trends. We can clearly see that from 1960 to 2020, the worldâ€™s population density is steadily increasing. This is due to the steady development of our science, technology and medical treatment, fewer diseases and longer life expectancy. However, there was a sharp decline between 2000 and 2001.</description>
